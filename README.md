# üñºÔ∏è Image Retrieval System using SIFT

This project implements a content-based image retrieval system that uses **SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)** for feature extraction and  **TF-IDF** weighting for image representation. The system supports image similarity search using **cosine similarity**, enabling retrieval of visually similar images from a dataset.

## üîç Features

* **üîë SIFT Feature Extraction**
  Extracts robust and scale-invariant keypoints and descriptors from each image using OpenCV's SIFT implementation.

* **üì¶ Visual Vocabulary Creation**
  Aggregates SIFT descriptors and applies **K-Means clustering** to form a visual vocabulary (codebook) of "visual words."

* **üìö TF-IDF Weighting**
  Enhances BoW vectors by applying **Term Frequency‚ÄìInverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)** to give higher weight to discriminative visual words.

* **üìà Cosine Similarity Matching**
  Computes cosine similarity between query and dataset vectors to rank and retrieve relevant images.

* **‚öôÔ∏è Parameter Optimization**
  Includes experimentation for:

  * Optimal number of K-Means centroids
  * Best subset of images for codebook creation
  * Performance comparison between BoW and TF-IDF vectors

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy scikit-learn matplotlib tqdm
   ```

2. **Prepare Image Dataset**:

   * Place your image files inside a directory, e.g., `dataset/`.
   * Update the `data_path` variable inside the notebook accordingly:

     ```python
     data_path = '/path/to/your/dataset/'
     ```

3. **Run the Notebook**:

   * Open `Image_Retrieval_using_SIFT.ipynb` using Jupyter Lab or Google Colab.
   * Run all cells sequentially.
   * The notebook will perform:

     * Feature extraction
     * Vector representation
     * Retrieval visualization and accuracy analysis
